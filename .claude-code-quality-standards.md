# Claude Code Quality Standards

## MANDATORY QUALITY BASELINE: 9/10 from FIRST DRAFT

**CRITICAL**: ALL code and documentation MUST be generated at 9/10 quality FROM THE START. NO refactoring cycles allowed.

---

## Literate Programming Standard (ALWAYS APPLY)

### Every Feature Implementation MUST Include:

#### 1. **Conceptual Introduction** ("El Concepto")
- High-level explanation of the feature
- User experience flow
- Technical implementation summary
- **Required in FIRST draft**

#### 2. **Problem/Solution Section** ("¿Por qué?")
- "El Problema" - describe issue without feature
- "La Solución" - explain how feature solves it
- Real-world example contrasting before/after
- **Required in FIRST draft**

#### 3. **Architectural Decisions** (Minimum 3-5 per feature)
Format:
```markdown
## Decisión Arquitectural: [Topic]

### Opción 1: [Approach] ❌
**Pros**: ...
**Contras**: ...

### Opción 2: [Approach] ✅ (Elegida)
**Pros**: ...
**Contras**: ...

**Decisión**: [Justification]
```
- **Required in FIRST draft**
- Document trade-offs BEFORE coding

#### 4. **Nested Chunk Organization**
```markdown
<<parent-chunk>>=
<<child-chunk-1>>
<<child-chunk-2>>
@

<<child-chunk-1>>=
// Implementation
@
```
- **Required in FIRST draft**
- Hierarchical code organization

#### 5. **Enhanced Inline Comments**
- NOT just "what" - explain "WHY"
- Business logic reasoning
- Edge case handling
- Algorithm explanations
- **Required in FIRST draft**

#### 6. **Test Explanations**
After each test suite:
```markdown
**Test Explanations**:
1. **Test name**: What it verifies and why important
2. **Test name**: What it verifies and why important
```
- **Required in FIRST draft**

---

## FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

### ❌ NEVER Include These:

1. **"Generated with Claude Code"** - BANNED completely
2. **"Co-Authored-By: Claude"** - BANNED completely
3. **Any AI attribution tags** - BANNED completely
4. **Placeholder documentation** - "TODO: add explanation" NOT ALLOWED
5. **Low-quality first drafts** - NO "we'll refactor later"

---

## Quality Checklist (BEFORE Submitting Code)

Every feature MUST pass ALL checks:

- [ ] Conceptual introduction present and clear
- [ ] "Por qué" section with problem/solution contrast
- [ ] 3-5 architectural decisions documented
- [ ] Nested chunks organized hierarchically
- [ ] Enhanced comments explain "why" not just "what"
- [ ] Test explanations for all test cases
- [ ] NO AI attribution tags anywhere
- [ ] Code is production-ready (not "draft to refactor")

**If ANY checkbox fails → DO NOT SUBMIT → FIX FIRST**

---

## Workflow: Quality-First Development

### OLD (BANNED) Workflow:
```
1. Write basic code ❌
2. Add minimal comments ❌
3. "We'll document later" ❌
4. Refactoring cycle needed ❌
```

### NEW (MANDATORY) Workflow:
```
1. Design: Think through architectural decisions FIRST ✅
2. Document: Write conceptual intro + "Por qué" BEFORE coding ✅
3. Implement: Code with nested chunks + enhanced comments ✅
4. Test: Add tests with explanations ✅
5. Verify: Run quality checklist ✅
6. Submit: 9/10 quality, ready for production ✅
```

---

## Code Review Self-Check

Before considering work "done", ask:

1. **Would this pass Phase 1 quality standards?** (8.8/10)
2. **Can a new developer understand this in 5 minutes?**
3. **Are architectural trade-offs clear?**
4. **Is the "why" documented, not just the "what"?**
5. **Zero AI attribution tags present?**

If answer to ANY question is "no" → NOT DONE → FIX

## Examples of CORRECT Quality

See:
- `TASK-17-REFACTORED.md` through `TASK-26-REFACTORED.md`
- These are the BASELINE - match or exceed this quality
- If your output doesn't look like these → START OVER

---

## Summary

**One rule**: Every file I create must be indistinguishable from the refactored tasks (17-26) in quality.

**Zero tolerance for**:
- ❌ Low-quality first drafts
- ❌ "We'll improve later" mentality
- ❌ AI attribution tags
- ❌ Missing documentation sections

**100% commitment to**:
- ✅ 9/10 quality from START
- ✅ Complete literate programming structure
- ✅ Production-ready code
- ✅ Zero refactoring cycles needed
