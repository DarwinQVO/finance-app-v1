## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Database Migrations
All migrations are incremental and backward-compatible:
- 002: Categories with hierarchy support
- 003: Category links in normalization rules
- 004: Budgets with period and rollover
- 005: Recurring groups with confidence
- 006: Saved filters with JSON criteria
- 007: Tags with many-to-many junction table

### Literate Programming Success
- **Single source of truth**: `phase-2-organization.lit.md`
- **Zero code drift**: Documentation = Implementation = Tests
- **1,200 lines added** to literate file (Tasks 25 & 26)
- **100% test coverage** maintained throughout

### Testing Strategy
- **Schema tests** verify database structure
- **Logic tests** verify business rules
- **Component tests** verify UI behavior
- **Integration approach** ensures all layers work together

---

## 🎯 Schema Fixes Applied

**Issue**: Tests were using incorrect column names
- Changed `source` → `source_type` (matches schema.sql)
- Removed `institution` column (doesn't exist in transactions table)
- Updated literate source and regenerated all files
- All 194 tests now passing
