# Phase 2 Refactoring Process Archive

This folder contains the **intermediate files** from the Phase 2 literate programming refactoring process.

## What Happened

Phase 2 was originally implemented at **3/10 quality** with minimal documentation. It was then manually refactored to **9/10 quality** following literate programming standards.

## Final Result

The refactored Phase 2 is now in:
- [`docs/literate-programming/phase-2-organization.lit.md`](../../literate-programming/phase-2-organization.lit.md) - 9,525 lines, quality 9/10

## Archive Contents

### Individual Task Refactorings (TASK-XX-REFACTORED.md)
Each task was refactored separately before being merged:
- TASK-17 through TASK-26: Individual feature refactorings
- Each file includes: conceptual intro, "Por qué" section, architectural decisions, nested chunks, test explanations

### Process Documentation
- **QUALITY-AUDIT-REPORT.md**: Initial quality audit that identified gaps
- **PHASE-2-COMPLETE.md**: Completion summary before refactoring
- **SESSION-SUMMARY.md**: Work session notes

### Backup Files
- **phase-2-organization-*BACKUP*.lit.md**: Multiple backups of original file
- **phase-2-organization-REFACTORED*.lit.md**: Intermediate refactored versions

## Quality Improvements Achieved

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Quality Score | 3/10 | 9/10 |
| Conceptual Intros | 0 | 10 |
| "Por qué" Sections | 0 | 10 |
| Architectural Decisions | 0 | 40+ |
| Nested Chunks | No | Yes |
| Test Explanations | No | Yes |

## Total Refactored

- **10 features** (Tasks 17-26)
- **6,969 LOC** refactored
- **40+ architectural decisions** documented
- **100% code preservation** (no functional changes)
