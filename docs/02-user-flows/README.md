1. Flow 1 (understand core concept)
2. Flow 2 (understand upload)
3. Flows 3-6 (understand Phase 1 features)
4. Pick flows based on what you're building

### For Product Managers
**Start here** ‚Üí Feature-based reading:
1. Flow 1 (core UX)
2. Flow 7 (categories)
3. Flow 8 (budgets)
4. Flow 10 (reports)

### For Designers
**Start here** ‚Üí UI-focused reading:

3. Flow 7 (category management)
4. Flow 15 (manual entry form)

### For QA/Testing
**Read** ‚Üí Edge cases sections:

## üìù Notes

### Why "el usuario"?
el usuario is our persona - a real person with real financial complexity (4 accounts, 2 years of data, 12k transactions). All flows are written from his perspective.

### Why ASCII Art Mockups?
- ‚úÖ Fast to create and iterate
- ‚úÖ Version control friendly (plain text)
- ‚úÖ Forces focus on UX, not visual polish
- ‚úÖ Readable in terminal, GitHub, anywhere

### Why Spanish?
Finance App documentation is in Spanish because:
- Original user (el usuario) is Spanish-speaking
- Easier to write naturally ("el usuario hace X")
- Code comments and variable names are still in English
