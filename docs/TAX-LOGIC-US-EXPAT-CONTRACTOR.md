## üåç International Tax Strategy

### ‚úÖ Primary Strategy: FEIE (Form 2555)

**Exclusion Amount**: $126,500 USD (2024)

**Qualification Tests** (need to meet ONE):
1. **Physical Presence Test**: 330+ days outside US in 12-month period ‚úÖ
2. **Bona Fide Residence Test**: Permanent resident in Mexico ‚úÖ

**CRITICAL**: FEIE does NOT exempt Self-Employment Tax!

### ‚ùå NOT Using: Foreign Tax Credit (Form 1116)

**Reason**: Cannot claim FTC on income already excluded with FEIE.

**When FTC is useful**:
- Income exceeds $126,500 FEIE limit (use FTC on excess)
- Not using FEIE at all
- Has passive income (dividends, interest)

**Our case**: Income < $126,500, so FEIE alone is optimal.

---

## üíµ Self-Employment Tax (CRITICAL)

**Form**: Schedule SE

**Rate**: 15.3% total
- 12.4% Social Security
- 2.9% Medicare

**Threshold**: Applies if net profit > $400

**IMPORTANT**:
- ‚úÖ FEIE excludes income from regular income tax
- ‚ùå FEIE does NOT exclude income from Self-Employment Tax
- You ALWAYS pay 15.3% on net profit, regardless of FEIE

**Example**:
```
Gross Income:     $80,000
Business Expenses: -$20,000
Net Profit:        $60,000

Self-Employment Tax = $60,000 √ó 15.3% = $9,180
Income Tax         = $0 (excluded by FEIE)
Total Tax Due      = $9,180
```

## üí° Tax Strategy Notes

**Current approach**: Use FEIE to exclude up to $126,500, still pay Self-Employment Tax on net profit.

**Why not use Foreign Tax Credit?**
- Already using FEIE to exclude income
- Cannot double-dip (FTC on excluded income)
- Mexico RESICO taxes already paid

**If income > $126,500**:
- FEIE excludes first $126,500
- Pay regular income tax on excess
- Could use Form 1116 (FTC) on excess to offset with Mexico taxes paid
